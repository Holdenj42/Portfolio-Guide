# Data Engineering

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| [AI/ML](https://github.com/Holdenj42/Fraud-Detection-Model) | January 2025 | Python, EDA, Machine Learning (scikit-learn), Visualization (matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook | I built a fraud detection model using a Kaggle dataset of transactional data.
